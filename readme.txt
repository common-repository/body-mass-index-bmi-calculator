= Information =

Body mass index or BMI is the calculation of the total body fat which is present in your body and it is calculated with reference to the height as well as the weight. So as expected, the body mass index of both men and women is different. It is calculated by dividing the mass of the body to the height of the body and hence the units of the resultant body mass index values are kg/m(square). However, BMI and weight are two different terms but it can give an idea of if a person is underweight or overweight and where he/she stands. 

= WHY SHOULD WE USE BMI CALCULATOR =
A BMI calculator requires two things. Your weight and height and by dividing the two, it calculates the resultant BMI. Moreover, it has a scale with the calculator where it indicates whether the person is underweight, overweight or perfectly-weighted and in the healthy range. The scale even indicates if the person is obese or not. 
Your health is related to your weight. Therefore, knowing the BMI holds great importance. Using a calculator makes it much easier, faster, precise and accurate. Moreover, if one does not know their standard BMI, the calculator will help you even compare your present BMI with your standard BMI and that too within seconds. So, you do not have to separately first calculate the BMI and then compare it with the standard BMI table, being unsure if your resultant is accurate. The calculator combines it all in and provides to you the easiest way to get the value and information required. 

= IMPORTANCE IN MEDICAL FIELDS = 
BMI is a very important value in medical field. Being obese and underweight, tend to cause a number of different health issues therefore, knowing where one stands in terms of weight and then working on maintaining it, is highly important. There is a standard BMI value for every person depending upon their weights and heights.

As many medical problems are caused due to weight problems and are concerned with it, therefore, the doctors prefer calculating the patient’s BMI and if they are overweight, underweight or obese, they tell them to first work on maintaining their BMI and then going for some medical treatment. Therefore, these values have to be known in medical fields. It is a value which is used to provide the initial direction to the doctor with the treatment.
